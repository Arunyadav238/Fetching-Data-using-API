This Python script fetches data about top-rated movies from The Movie Database (TMDB) API and saves it as a CSV file named "movies.csv".

Requirements:

Python 3.x
pandas library (pip install pandas)
requests library (pip install requests)
TMDB API key (Sign up for a free developer account at https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started)
Instructions:

Replace YOUR_API_KEY in the script with your actual TMDB API key.
Run the script: python movie_scraper.py (assuming you saved the script as "movie_scraper.py").
Output:

The script will create a CSV file named "movies.csv" containing information about top-rated movies, including:

id
title
overview
release_date
popularity
vote_average
vote_count
How it Works:

The script utilizes the requests library to interact with the TMDB API. It fetches data from multiple pages of top-rated movies and combines them into a single DataFrame using the pandas library. Finally, the DataFrame is saved as a CSV file.

Note:

This script retrieves data from the first 428 pages of the TMDB API results for top-rated movies. The API might have more pages depending on the total number of movies.
Remember to update the script if the TMDB API structure or parameters change.
Further Exploration:

This script provides a basic example of using the TMDB API. You can explore the TMDB API documentation (https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) to discover other functionalities and retrieve additional movie information.
